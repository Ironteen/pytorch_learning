# pytorch learning record

###### Come on,  you are not only an Ironboy, but also a moving bricks boy!

## Why I choose torch?

Because TensorFlow is bullshit......

## Environment

- numpy 1.16.2
- torch 1.0.1
- torchvision
- Visual Studio Code——sublime is ugly and pycharm takes up too much memory!
- dataset : MNIST

## What I learning about?

1. build a basic LeNet-5 with CPU

   ```
   python LeNet-5_basic.py
   ```

2. build a LeNet-5 with GPU

   ```
   python LeNet-5_cuda.py
   ```

3. build a LeNet-5 which could saves the net and parameter

   ```
   python LeNet-5_save.py
   ```

4. build a LeNet-5 which could reload the parameters and continue to train faster

   ```
   python LeNet-5_reload.py
   ```
